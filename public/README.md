# Hotel Website Project

This project is a hotel website built with React for the frontend. It requires a PHP backend for database operations.

## Project Structure

- `/src` - React frontend code
- `/api` - PHP backend API
- `/public` - Static assets

## Deployment Options

### 1. GitHub Pages (Frontend Only)

GitHub Pages can only host the static frontend portion. For database functionality, you'll need a separate backend service.

### 2. Traditional Web Hosting (Full Stack)

For a complete solution with the PHP backend:

- Hostinger
- Bluehost
- InfinityFree
- 000webhost

### 3. Modern Hosting (Separate Frontend and Backend)

- Frontend: GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
- Backend: Deploy the PHP API to a PHP-capable hosting service

## Database Setup

The project uses MySQL with the following connection details:

- Host: sql110.infinityfree.com
- Port: 3306
- Username: if0_38602606
- Password: TNSCnG7Hr-fNLf
- Database: if0_38602606_XXX

## Setup Instructions
